# Sort the data by finding out which trainer has the strongest pokemon so that this will act as a ranking of strongest to weakest trainer. 
You may interpret strongest in whatever way you want, but you will have to explain your decision.

By finding the average score of the pokemon's stats for the trainers, I am declareing Ace Duo Elina & Sean is the strongest.
This one is interesting beacuse it is listing their two sets of 6 pokemon, giving them a total of 12.
However, the first 6 have a score of 130.3333 while the second 6 have a score of 128.5.
